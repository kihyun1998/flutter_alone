## Getting started

Add flutter_alone to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_alone: ^1.0.0
```

## Usage

Import the package:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_alone/flutter_alone.dart';
```

Initialize in your main function:
```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  final flutterAlone = FlutterAlone.instance;
  final canRun = await flutterAlone.checkAndRun();
  
  if (!canRun) {
    // Another instance is already running
    exit(0);
  }
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

Clean up resources when your app closes:
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  FlutterAlone.instance.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Additional information
